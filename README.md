## ratio-calculator

This app was built as a companion for crafting games such as Satisfactory and Factorio.

Choose a recipe and click to expand each ingredient to view whatever depth in the crafting tree you desire. 

The frontend is in JS and the backend is in express and mongoDB where the recipies are stored

Hosted at https://ratio-calculator.herokuapp.com/

## Note
Currently the back end is not hooked up until I figure out ports and allowing DB access through Heroku.
The page loads and displays menus, there are just no recipies to craft.
